**Part 1 String Server**<br>
**Code part**<br>
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Handler implements URLHandler {
    // The one bit of state on the server: a number that will be manipulated by
    // various requests.
    ArrayList<String> words_arr = new ArrayList<String>();
    String output = "";
    public String handleRequest(URI url) {
        System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
        if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {
            String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
            if (parameters[0].equals("s")) {
                words_arr.add(parameters[1]);
                for (String s : words_arr) {
                    if(output.indexOf(s) == -1) {
                        output += s + "\n"; 
                    }       	
                }
            }
        }		
        return output;
        }
}

class StringServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if(args.length == 0){
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        Server.start(port, new Handler());
    }
}
```

* In this screenshot, `handleRequest` and main method in StringServer.java file are called.
* The relevant argument is `4700` and `/add-message?s=Good Morning`. The value are Arraylist `words_arr` and String `output`.
* When the argument is passed into the Hanlder method, `/add-message?s=Good Morning` is break down into path + query. First, the method will check whether the value contains the path `/add-message`. If it does, it will extract the query part which is the `?s=Good Morning`. Specifically, it will extract two parameters: `s` and the content after equal sign. In this example, the first parameter is 's' and the second one is `Good Morning`. Then,`Good Morning` will bed added into into the arraylist `word_arr`. If the element is never found in String `output`, then output will concatenate this element with a newline character `\n`. Finally, `output` is returned.

Right now, String `output` contains two words "Good Morning\n" and "Good Night\n". Finally, `output` is returned.

**Part 2 Bug Analysis**<br>
I choose bugs from reverseInPlace method in Array Methods part.<br>
Failure-inducing input:<br>
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input2 = {1,2,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(input2));
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, input2);
}
```
Input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure: <br>
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = {5};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

The symptom:<br>

Code before fixing:<br>
```
for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
     arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
   }
}
```
Here the bug is that this method traverse the whole array. When half of the elements are swapped, the rest of elements are actually copying the values of first half of the elements.

Code after fixing:
```
for(int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i += 1) {
  int temp  = arr[i];
  arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
} 
```
Instead of creating a new array, we can reverse the original array in place by traversing only half of its elements. During this process, we can use a temporary variable to store the value of an element before swapping it with its counterpart. By swapping the first and last elements and continuing this process until the index i reaches the value of length/2, we can avoid swapping the same elements more than once.<br>

**Part 3 Reflection**<br>
In these two weeks, I learned how to analyze the different components of a URL and understand how they work together. Additionally, I learned how to use Junit to locate and resolve bugs in my code. The concepts introduced in week 3 were particularly useful as they shows the importance of testing different inputs to ensure the overall functionality of a program. This taught me that just because a program does not fail with a certain input, it does not mean that it has no bugs. Therefore, it is important to test programs with different inputs to ensure they are functioning as we want.
